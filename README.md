# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
# Algorithm:
# Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

# Step 2:
Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()

# Step 3:
And give variable in inside np.linalg.inv inbuild method we could use and print the result

# Step 4:
End the program

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

#RegisterNumber:212225240061
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
result=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(result)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
